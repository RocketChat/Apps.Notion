## üìú Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   You need a Rocket.Chat Server Setup
-   Rocket.Chat.Apps CLI,

*   In case you don't have run:
    ```sh
    npm install -g @rocket.chat/apps-cli
    ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

-   Every RocketChat Apps runs on RocketChat Server, thus everytime you wanna test you need to deploy the app with this note. lets start setting up:

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/Apps.Notion
    ```
2. Install NPM packages
    ```sh
    npm ci
    ```
3. Deploy app using:

    ```sh
    rc-apps deploy --url <url> --username <username> --password <password>
    ```

4. Once its deploy, Go to Installed Apps and Settings tab in RC,you would see two input fields:

    ```

     # notion-client-id
     # notion-client-secret
     // Generate above Credentials from Notion By Creating the *Public* Integration.
     // https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#how-to-make-an-integration-public

    ```

5. Once Its done save the changes, and now under the Notion Integration Provide the Webhook GET endpoint in Redirect URI field of Notion, GET Webhook Endpoint: you can find on the Current App Info under Detail tab in RC.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## ‚úÖ About The Project:

```

- Integrate Notion Via RC App prioritizes teamwork by enhancing collaboration for Notion Users. Imagine having the power
of two essential platforms,RocketChat and Notion, united as one, eliminating the need to switch between two platforms.
Teams can Seamlessly connect, effortlessly manage various Notion workspaces, Share documents, and Even View Documents
all within RocketChat.
- The real magic lies in Preserving your Important message inside the Notion Page, Structured within the Notion Database,
ensuring vital discussions, decisions, and insights are never lost again, fostering alignment and inclusivity as everyone
stays on the same page, even if they're not actively chatting. Whether it's brainstorming sessions, meeting notes,
or shared links, find them all in one organized place. Plus, Create Comments on the Notion Page, view the Notion Database,
and interact with relevant information.
- Furthermore, do you have a backlog? need to assign tasks, set priorities, or have updates on project status?
No worries; Update Notion database entries without leaving Rocket.Chat. Welcome to a new era of streamlined collaboration,
Where RocketChat and Notion work together seamlessly to fuel your team's success.

```

### This Project Includes Backward Compatible Approach for Authorization:

-   Following things aren't possible with current apps-engine framework version (when writing this).

1.  Incase of any platform Authorization workflow can alter than the usual. In Case of Notion, it suggests to use Basic HTTP Authentication when requesting for access_token while providing the code [check here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#step-3-the-integration-sends-the-code-in-a-post-request-to-the-notion-api)
2.  Now incase of usual workflow we provide the clientId and clientSecret in params but Notion and in future we may encounter any other platform which would suggest different ways to provide credentials in Authorization header. In case of Notion they suggested to provide the credentials in form of `Basic CLIENTID:CLIENTSECRET` where the credentials provide should be a base64.
3.  In case of any platform we may need the extra info in persistance storage. In case of Notion we needed a lot of extra fields which includes workspace info, access_level of pages, userInfo including the access_token_info etc. [check here](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#step-4-notion-responds-with-an-access_token-and-some-additional-information)

## :rocket: Usage :
